    <h2>Spider Name: Black Widow</h2>
    <p>The Black Widow spider is one of the most well-known and feared spiders in the world. It has a glossy black body with a distinctive red hourglass marking on the underside of its abdomen.</p>
    <p>While the bite of a Black Widow can be venomous to humans, it is rarely fatal. Symptoms of a bite include muscle pain, nausea, and difficulty breathing, but with proper medical treatment, full recovery is expected. These spiders are usually found in dark, undisturbed places such as woodpiles, basements, and garages.</p>

    <h2>Spider Name: Tarantula</h2>
    <p>Tarantulas are among the largest spiders in the world, with some species reaching up to 10 inches in leg span. Despite their fearsome appearance, they are relatively harmless to humans. Tarantulas prefer to live in burrows and are often found in deserts, rainforests, and grasslands.</p>
    <p>They are popular pets among spider enthusiasts due to their docile nature. Tarantulas are carnivorous and feed primarily on insects, but larger species can occasionally prey on small mammals, birds, and amphibians. Their venom is used to paralyze their prey, though it is not dangerous to humans.</p>

    <h2>Spider Name: Jumping Spider</h2>
    <p>Jumping spiders are small, agile hunters that can leap several times their body length to catch their prey. They have excellent vision and are often recognized by their large, forward-facing eyes. Unlike other spiders, jumping spiders actively hunt during the day and rely on their speed and agility to capture prey rather than webs.</p>
    <p>These spiders are often found in gardens, homes, and forests, and are known for their curious behavior. Some species are even brightly colored, making them a popular subject for macro photography. Despite their small size, they are very effective hunters and play a crucial role in controlling insect populations.</p>

    <h2>Spider Name: Wolf Spider</h2>
    <p>The Wolf spider is a solitary and fast-moving spider that hunts its prey on the ground. Unlike most spiders that rely on webs, Wolf spiders chase down their prey and overpower them. They have strong, muscular legs that allow them to run quickly, and their name comes from their hunting style, which resembles that of wolves.</p>
    <p>These spiders can be found in a wide range of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and even deserts. They are usually brown or gray with a camouflage pattern that helps them blend into their surroundings. Although they can bite if provoked, their venom is not harmful to humans.</p>

    <h2>Spider Name: Orb Weaver</h2>
    <p>Orb Weavers are known for their beautiful, intricate webs that are often seen in gardens and forests. These webs are used to catch flying insects, which the spider wraps in silk before consuming. Orb Weavers are generally harmless to humans and are considered beneficial due to their role in controlling insect populations.</p>
    <p>They are often brightly colored, with some species displaying vibrant yellows, reds, and blues. Orb Weavers can be found on every continent except Antarctica and are one of the most common types of spiders in the world. They are most active during the warmer months, especially at night when they repair and rebuild their webs.</p>
